====================

Budspencer and Terencehill themes for the oh-my-zsh prompt

# Obsolete
I switched to [prezto][3]. You can find an advanced budspencer, terencehill and
dangerous theme there.

# Why?
Emacs mode is frustrating in a shell for vi users. The different vi-modes can be
confusing as well if you cannot realize which mode is active. A clearly visible
indicator can improve your life. Budspencer and Terencehill tell you where you are.

# Requirements
* zsh
* [oh-my-zsh][1]
* [powerline font][2] (not needed for terencehill theme)

# Installation
* Copy ```budspencer.zsh-theme``` and ```terencehill.zsh-theme```
    into the ```~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes``` directory.
* Set ```ZSH_THEME="budspencer"``` or ```ZSH_THEME="terencehill"``` in your
    ```.zshrc```.
