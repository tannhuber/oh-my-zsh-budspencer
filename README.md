oh-my-zsh-budspencer
====================

budspencer theme for the oh-my-zsh prompt

# Why?
Emacs mode is frustrating in a shell for vi users. The different vi-modes can be
confusing as well if you cannot realize which mode is active. A clearly visible
indicator can improve your life. Budspencer tells you where you are.

# Requirements
* zsh
* [oh-my-zsh][1]
* [powerline font][2]

# Installation
* copy ```budspencer.zsh-theme``` into the ```~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes``` directory
